	 *  General Plan for how code will work
	 *  1. Create an instance of Message Class when an input is entered
	 *  	1.1. String gets interpretted by DialogFlow
	 *  			- note that DialogFlow is not directly creating a reply, 
	 *  			  rather it determines how we want to reply
	 *  2. Reply is generated from a method we design. 
	 *     This method should basically echo the input in a plausable way
	 *  3. Reply is outputted to User
